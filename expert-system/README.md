## Assignment Prompt
You are to write a backwards-chaining expert system. The engine main function is to be called prove?, returning T or NILdepending on whether the goal can be proven or not. It will be called with three parameters: the conclusion symbol, a list of facts, and a list of rules. The rules may contain AND, OR, and NOT as logical operators in the condition, but the conclusions consist of a single fact. AND and OR can take an arbitrary number of operands, but NOT takes only one expression. For a stretch goal (see the grading guidelines), prove? must explain -- in situations where the goal is provable -- how the conclusion was reached.
